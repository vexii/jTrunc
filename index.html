		<p>We really recommend <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com" target="_blank">Firefox</a> as the primary browser for the best editing experience, but of course, TinyMCE is <a href="../wiki.php/Browser_compatiblity" target="_blank">compatible</a> with all major browsers.</p>

Also do not miss out on the <a href="../wiki.php">documentation</a>, its a great resource wiki for understanding how TinyMCE works and integrates.</p>
